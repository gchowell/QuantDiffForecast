Parameter estimation, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification for ODE models

Video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyyX63H12sY&t=41s

It carries out the following tasks: 

•	fitting ODE models to time series data,
•	estimation of model parameters with quantified uncertainty, Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSES),
•	plotting the best fit of the ODE model, calibration performance metrics, and empirical distribution of the parameters
•	plotting forecasts from the best-fit model and performance metrics of the forecasts,
•	conducts rolling window analyses of parameter estimates for specific periods and window sizes
Additional features include:

•	fitting models using different parameter estimation approaches (least-squares, maximum likelihood estimation),
•	fitting models using assuming different error structures (normal, Poisson, negative binomial),
•	User can conduct multiple fits of the model to the data through a rolling window analysis
