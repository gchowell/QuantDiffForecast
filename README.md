# QuantDiffForecast: A MATLAB Toolbox for Parameter Estimation and Forecasting with ODE Models

Welcome to **QuantDiffForecast**, a MATLAB toolbox designed to estimate parameters and generate short-term forecasts with quantified uncertainty from dynamical models based on **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**. This toolbox is user-friendly, flexible, and suitable for applications across various scientific fields, including epidemiology and population dynamics.

## Features

- **Parameter estimation**: Provides methods for parameter estimation using nonlinear least squares (NLS) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), with support for Poisson, negative binomial, and normal error structures.
- **Forecasting with quantified uncertainty**: Generates forecasts using parametric bootstrapping to provide uncertainty quantification and prediction intervals.
- **Flexible model input**: Users can define their own ODE models and parameter ranges, supported by customizable input files.
- **Rolling window analysis**: Evaluate parameter stability and forecast performance over time.
- **Illustrative examples**: Includes built-in examples such as epidemic models applied to the 1918 influenza pandemic.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to create a `.txt` file containing your time-series data. Place this file in the `input` folder, and then specify the ODE model and related parameters in the MATLAB `.m` files. 

### Example: SEIR Model for Epidemics

The simplest example provided in this repository is an SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model, applied to data from the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco.

1. Specify the SEIR model parameters in `options_fit.m` and `options_forecast.m`.
2. Use the provided script `Run_Fit_ODEModel.m` to estimate parameters and fit the model to data:

   ```matlab
   Run_Fit_ODEModel(@options_fit_SEIR_flu1918,1,1,17)
   ```

3. Visualize the fit and generate forecasts using:

   ```matlab
   plotFit_ODEModel(@options_fit_SEIR_flu1918,1,1,17)
   Run_Forecasting_ODEModel(@options_forecast_SEIR_flu1918,1,1,17,10)
   ```
