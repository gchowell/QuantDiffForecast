# QuantDiffForecast: A MATLAB Toolbox for Parameter Estimation and Forecasting with ODE Models

Welcome to **QuantDiffForecast**, a MATLAB toolbox designed to estimate parameters and generate short-term forecasts with quantified uncertainty from dynamical models based on **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)**. This toolbox is user-friendly, flexible, and suitable for applications across various scientific fields, including epidemiology and population dynamics.

<p> QuantDiffForecast Tutorial: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.10036 </p>
<p>Video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyyX63H12sY&t=41s</p>

<p> It carries out the following tasks: </p> 
<ul>
<li> fitting ODE models to a single or multiple time series,</li>
<li> estimation of model parameters with quantified uncertainty, Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSES),</li>
<li>	plotting the best fit of the ODE model, calibration performance metrics, and empirical distribution of the parameters </li>
<li> plotting forecasts from the best-fit model and performance metrics of the forecasts,</li>
<li> conducts rolling window analyses of parameter estimates for specific periods and window sizes</li>

</ul>

  Additional features include:

<ul>
  
<li>fitting models using different parameter estimation approaches (least-squares, maximum likelihood estimation),</li>
<li>fitting models using assuming different error structures (normal, Poisson, negative binomial),</li>
<li>User can conduct multiple fits of the model to the data through a rolling window analysis </li>

</ul>
